🧮 Challenge 1: Quantum Random Walk for Put and Call Options

In this challenge, you’ll calculate the prices of put and call options using a quantum random walk.

These options are based on the Black–Scholes model, which assumes a constant interest rate and volatility.

Concept recap:

A call option gives the right to buy an asset at a specific price and time.

A put option gives the right to sell an asset at a specific price and time.

The strike price is that specific predetermined price — for example, a call option to buy one share of the S&P 500 at $10,000 in three months.


Your goals:

Use a quantum random walk to obtain an approximate price for put and call options given a set of parameters.

Compare your quantum results with classical calculations under the Black–Scholes framework.
